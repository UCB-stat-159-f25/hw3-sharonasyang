This repo focuses on binary black hole signals in LIGO open data and is a continuation of [LIGO repo for HW2](https://github.com/UCB-stat-159-f25/hw-2-sharonasyang). With the files in the repo, any user can run the LOSC_Event_tutorial file by clicking on the Binder link below, which can be run without the user installing anything locally. Building on top of the HW 2 repo, the output (data, figures, and audio) are stored in their own folders. Previously, ligotools was useable as a local package only, but it is now available as an installable package. This repo also includes tests for some ligotool functions and can be built as a proper MyST.
